# Auto Journal
### About
Auto Journal is a script utility that formats and organizes simple notes into structured journal entries. It is intended as a minimalist system that is simple to use and storage-conservative. 
### Compatibility
Auto Journal was developed on a machine running Windows 10 and written for a bash interpreter. It has not been tested in other environments, but may work on some.

### Setting Up

### Usage
Auto Journal takes your thoughts, polishes them into a finished journal entry, and stores this inside an organized Archive folder for you to access later.



- **Simple and secure.**
    - No network connection is required.
    - Code is simple enough to inspect yourself.
- **Journal entries are stored in .txt files for space efficiency.**
    - 100 years of writing 1200-word (~8KB) journal entries every day takes up less than 290MB, or 0.29GB. This can easily be stored on an inexpensive flash drive.
- **Entries are organized inside a simple directory structure for easy searching.**
    - The Archive folder contains folders for each year, each named "yyyy".
        - e.g. "2021"
    - Each month folder contains the journal entries for that month.
    - Each journal entry is named "dd_mon_yyyy.txt" to ensure proper ordering
